# /roadmap - Android Development Roadmap

Complete Android development learning path based on developer-roadmap.sh Android developer pathway.

## 7-Step Learning Journey

### Step 1: Fundamentals (172 hours)
**Kotlin, Java, OOP, SOLID principles, algorithms**

- Kotlin language essentials (syntax, features, coroutines)
- Object-oriented programming principles
- SOLID design principles (5 principles)
- Functional programming concepts
- Data structures and algorithms
- Exception handling and memory management

**Path:** Variables → Functions → Classes → OOP → SOLID → Algorithms

---

### Step 2: Platform (78 hours)
**Android core components and lifecycle management**

- Activities and complete lifecycle (6 callbacks)
- Fragments and fragment lifecycle (10 callbacks)
- Services (started, bound, foreground)
- Intent system (explicit, implicit, filters)
- BroadcastReceiver and messaging
- ContentProvider for data sharing
- Permissions (normal and dangerous)
- Process lifecycle and death handling

**Path:** Activity → Fragment → Services → Intent → Permissions

---

### Step 3: UI Development (235 hours)
**Layouts, ConstraintLayout, Jetpack Compose, Material Design**

- XML Layouts (LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, GridLayout)
- ConstraintLayout (constraints, chains, guidelines, barriers)
- Jetpack Compose (composables, state, modifiers)
- Material Design 3 (components, theming, typography)
- RecyclerView and adaptive layouts
- Accessibility standards
- Responsive design patterns

**Path:** XML → ConstraintLayout → Compose → Material Design

---

### Step 4: Data Management (62 hours)
**Room, SQLite, SharedPreferences, DataStore, encryption**

- Room ORM (entities, DAOs, database)
- SQLite direct queries
- SharedPreferences (basic and encrypted)
- DataStore (preferences and proto)
- Data encryption and security
- Database migrations
- Transaction management
- Database testing

**Path:** SharedPreferences → Room → Encryption → DataStore

---

### Step 5: Networking (75 hours)
**Retrofit, OkHttp, REST APIs, JSON processing**

- REST API concepts (HTTP methods, status codes)
- Retrofit (interfaces, converters, interceptors)
- OkHttp (client, networking, SSL pinning)
- JSON serialization (GSON, Moshi)
- Error handling and retries
- Network security (SSL pinning, certificate pinning)
- Network monitoring and optimization
- Testing network calls

**Path:** REST → Retrofit → OkHttp → Security

---

### Step 6: Architecture (40 hours)
**MVVM, Clean Architecture, Repository, SOLID**

- MVVM pattern (Model, View, ViewModel)
- Clean Architecture (4 layers)
- Repository pattern (data abstraction)
- SOLID principles implementation
- Design patterns (factory, observer, strategy)
- Dependency injection (Hilt, Dagger)
- Testable architecture
- Layer separation

**Path:** MVVM → Clean Architecture → Repository → SOLID

---

### Step 7: Production (95 hours)
**Testing, Performance, Security, Deployment**

- Unit testing (JUnit, Mockito)
- UI testing (Espresso)
- Performance optimization (profiling, memory, battery)
- Memory leak detection
- Security best practices (encryption, SSL pinning)
- OWASP Mobile Top 10
- Play Store deployment (tracks, rollout, monitoring)
- Crash analytics and monitoring

**Path:** Testing → Performance → Security → Deployment
